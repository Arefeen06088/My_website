## About Me

I am Asiful Arefeen, PhD student in the Biomedical Informatics program at Arizona State University (ASU). I am working as a graduate research assistant at the [Embedded Machine Intelligence Lab (EMIL)](https://ghasemzadeh.com/) led by [Dr Hassan Ghasemzadeh](https://chs.asu.edu/hassan-ghasemzadeh).

Before ASU, I started my PhD in Computer Science at Washington State University (WSU) in 2020 but got transferred after a year. Prior to WSU, I completed my undergrad from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) back in 2019.

I am interested in Explainable AI, Counterfactual Explanations techniques, AI driven intervention design, and Machine Learning Applications in Health Monitoring Algorithm/System development.
